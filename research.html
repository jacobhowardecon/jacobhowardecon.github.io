<strong><a href="docs/Howard_matching.pdf" target="_blank"> Labor Market Frictions and Endogenous Production Network Formation</a></strong><br>
<small>Job Market Paper</small><br>
<button class="accordion">Abstract</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p class = "abstract">This paper studies the interaction of labor-market frictions and
	endogenous production-network formation in firms' decisions on employment,
	sourcing and production, within the context of trade policy. I construct a
	quantitative general-equilibrium model featuring worker-firm and firm-to-firm
	matching in the production process. I calibrate the model and investigate how trade policy
	and labor-market efficiency affect production-network density, trade flows,
	unemployment and wage inequality. The model shows a 1.5% decrease in relative
	labor-market frictions in one country can lead to a 0.1% decrease in the
	partner country's relative number of downstream production-network linkages. I
	explore how heterogeneity in firm-to-firm matching costs determines the effect
	of a trade shock on wage inequality. I show that a protectionist tariff by one
	country leads to increases in domestic long-run unemployment and real wages.
	Examining these channels separately leads to sizable quantitative and
	qualitative changes in the predicted outcomes of trade policy.</p>

<strong>Regional Environmental Quality and International Trade: The Role of Production Networks </strong><br>
<a href="http://doyoungpark.com/">
<small>with Doyoung Park</small></a> <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/ridleywc/research><small> and William Ridley</small></a> <br>
<button class="accordion">Abstract</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p class = "abstract">This paper studies the interaction between trade
		liberalization and firm production networks in shaping spatial differences
		in environmental quality within countries. We first analyze the effect of
		inter-firm trade in intermediate goods on the level of total regional
		emissions and average emission intensities. Second, we study the effect of
		trade liberalization on the spatial distribution of firms within countries
		in a setting with firm-to-firm production networks. We find that regions
		with relative proximity to foreign markets attract more firms as
		international trade barriers diminish. This leads to higher total emissions
		in such regions due to agglomeration forces, whereas spatial selection
		together with production networks leads to a decline in average emission
		intensities.</p>

	<strong>The Impacts of Intellectual-Property Related Preferential Trade Agreements on Bilateral Patent Applications </strong><br>
	<small>Link to paper coming soon</small><br>
	<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/kmaskus/"><small>with Keith Maskus</small></a> <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/ridleywc/research><small> and William Ridley</small></a> <br>
	<button class="accordion">Abstract</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p class = "abstract">Intellectual property rights (IPRs) have become an area of
			increasing emphasis in the negotiation of “deep” preferential trade agreements (PTAs)
			containing provisions on regulatory environments besides trade policy. These provisions
			typically require member countries to implement heightened standards on various aspects
			of IPRs, such as coverage and enforcement, that go beyond the baseline requirements of
			international IPRs agreements such as the World Tarde Organization’s (WTO) Trade-Related
			Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. In this study, we implement a
			structural gravity framework to empirically investigate the impacts of these agreements
			on bilateral international patenting to quantify the effects of countries’ membership in
			IP-related PTAs on within-agreement patent applications at national patent offices, as well
			as extra-PTA patenting at member-country destinations originating from non-member countries.
			We further explore the heterogeneity of these effects as originating from the attributes of
			the agreements, such as whether the major partner in the agreement partner is the United States
			or the EU/EFTA, and the presence of key “TRIPS-Plus” provisions in the agreement texts. Our findings
			suggest that IPRs standards in PTAs tend to generate positive impacts on international patenting,
			and that the specific features of the agreements give rise to significant disparities in these impacts.
			Most intriguing is that those agreements involving multiple TRIPS-Plus norms significantly increase
			patenting within members compared to patenting from outside those areas, while other types of IPAs
			encourage more patenting from non-members.</p>

<strong>The Impact of Offshoring and Outsourcing Firm Behaviors on Labor Market Outcomes</strong><br>
<small>Census Project hosted at the Georgetown Massive Data Institute FSRDC</small><br>
	<button class="accordion"> Description </button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p class = "abstract">
			This project proposes to answer the following questions.
			What role do supply chains play in shaping wage inequality?
			How do these supply chains vary by firm productivity levels, and is there
			a systematic differential response of these supply chains to an
			international trade shock? If wages are determined by supply chains,
			this implies that there will be nominal wage consequences for workers in
			all sectors of the importing economy. How much do changes, due to trade
			shocks, in firm-level supply-chains spillover into non-import competing sectors?
			Within all sectors are there heterogeneous responses to trade shocks that
			vary by firm size and what are the implications of this heterogeneity? </p>
