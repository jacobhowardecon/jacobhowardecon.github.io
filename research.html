<ul>
<li class = "abstract"><p>This paper highlights the importance of endogenous production networks in exposing 
workers in non-import competing sectors to trade shocks in other sectors. Firms 
trade in intermediates to establish a production network, and workers are complements 
to these intermediates. When there is a trade shock in an import competing sector, workers
in any sector whose employer trades with the import competing sector face changes in 
their nominal wages.</p></li>

Trade Liberalization, Firm Production Networks and the Regional Environment</a></li>
<li class = "note">with Doyoung Park</li>
<ul>
<li class = "abstract"><p> This paper provides a simple theoretical framework which demonstrates that the 
reduction of international trade costs can be one of the channels which causes the 
coastal areas to experience greater total emissions, but lower emission intensities 
compared to interior regions when firms are interconnected through the networks. We 
first analyze the role of production networks on total emissions and emission intensities 
of firms, and second, its role in affecting firms' optimal locations between coastal and 
inland regions. This paper finds that networks enlarge total emissions of firms due to 
expanded scale of productions. However, the linkages among firms reduce emission intensities 
through the outsourcing activities of intermediate goods which enable firms to utilize less 
carbon-intensive inputs. International trade cost reductions incentivize the most 
productive and large firms to agglomerate towards the coastal regions because of greater
expected profits arising from the reduction of transportation costs and improved 
matching probability with foreign trade partners. Firm-linkages magnify the coastal 
agglomeration of firms as it attracts smaller firms which desire to keep relationships 
with large firms. Therefore, trade liberalization under the environment in which firms are 
interconnected causes regional heterogeneity in environmental quality. The coastal 
concentration of firms induces greater share of total emissions to be allocated to 
the coastal regions. However, the networks established in the coastal regions foster 
outsourcing activities between firms, which in turn reduce the regional emission 
intensities. </p></li>
