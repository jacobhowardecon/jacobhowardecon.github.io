<strong>Endogenous Production Networks and the Labor Market Consequences of Globalization</strong><br>
<small> Please <a href="mailto:Jacob.b.howard@colorado.edu" target="_blank">email me</a> for the most current draft</small><br>
<button class="accordion">Abstract</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p class = "abstract">This paper highlights the importance of endogenous production networks in exposing
	workers in non-import competing sectors to trade shocks in other sectors. Firms
	trade in intermediates to establish a production network, and workers are complements
	to these intermediates. When there is a trade shock in an import competing sector, workers
	in any sector whose employer trades with the import competing sector face changes in
	their nominal wages.</p>

<strong>Trade Liberalization, Firm Production Networks and the Regional Environment</strong><br>
<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/colorado.edu/doyoungeconphd/research">
<small>with Doyoung Park</small></a><br>
<button class="accordion">Abstract</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p class = "abstract">This paper studies the interaction between trade
		liberalization and firm production networks in shaping spatial differences
		in environmental quality within countries. We first analyze the effect of
		inter-firm trade in intermediate goods on the level of total regional
		emissions and average emission intensities. Second, we study the effect of
		trade liberalization on the spatial distribution of firms within countries
		in a setting with firm-to-firm production networks. We find that regions
		with relative proximity to foreign markets attract more firms as
		international trade barriers diminish. This leads to higher total emissions
		in such regions due to agglomeration forces, whereas spatial selection
		together with production networks leads to a decline in average emission
		intensities.</p>

<strong>The Impact of Offshoring and Outsourcing Firm Behaviors on Labor Market Outcomes</strong><br>
<small>Census Project hosted at the Rocky Mountain Research Data Center</small><br>
	<button class="accordion"> Description </button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p class = "abstract">
			This project proposes to answer the following questions.
			What role do supply chains play in shaping wage inequality?
			How do these supply chains vary by firm productivity levels, and is there
			a systematic differential response of these supply chains to an
			international trade shock? If wages are determined by supply chains,
			this implies that there will be nominal wage consequences for workers in
			all sectors of the importing economy. How much do these supply chain
			changes due to trade shocks spillover into non-import competing sectors?
			Within all sectors are there heterogeneous responses to trade shocks that
			vary by firm size and what are the implications of this heterogeneity? </p>
